# Nuvio: releasing to the Polestar 3 via Google Play

## Release state (update after every confirmed upload)

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Release application ID | `com.JF_Nuvio` |
| **Last uploaded to Play** | **141 (0.5.8)**, confirmed by the owner from Play Console on 2026-10-02 |
| Code in the repo now | 142 (0.5.9), ready for the next upload |
| Version file | `iosApp/Configuration/Version.xcconfig` (`CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` is the Android version code, `MARKETING_VERSION` the name; Android reads this file) |
| Release key | `Key.jks` in the AAOS folder containing both repos (outside the repo; keep a backup) |
| Who signs and uploads | The owner, with Android Studio and Play Console. Agents prepare and verify. |

## The version-code rule (hard rule)

Play Console rejects any upload whose version code was already used, so every bundle needs a code **strictly higher than every code ever uploaded**. Upstream's version numbers have nothing to do with it.

- At the end of any session that changes app code, make sure the code in the repo is **higher than "Last uploaded to Play"**. If it already is, leave it (one bump per upload, not per commit). Raise the version name's patch number alongside it so builds are identifiable.
- After an upstream merge, check it again; the merge can bring back a lower number.
- Agents cannot see Play Console. If Play says "version code already used", raise the code by one, rebuild, and update the table above.
- Docs-only changes need no bump.

## Steps

1. **Agent: prepare.** On `main`, work verified. Apply the version-code rule above and confirm the values in `iosApp/Configuration/Version.xcconfig` (`CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` is the Android version code, `MARKETING_VERSION` the name; Android reads this file).
2. **Agent: check the build.** `./gradlew :androidApp:bundlePlaystoreRelease`. Nuvio's git-ignored `local.properties` also points Gradle at the key (`NUVIO_RELEASE_STORE_FILE=../Key.jks`), so Gradle can sign too. The wizard is still the standard path so both apps are released the same way. Never print, copy or commit the passwords in `local.properties`. Inspect the merged release manifest: application ID `com.JF_Nuvio`, version code/name, min/target SDK, automotive and camera features optional.
3. **Owner: sign in Android Studio.** Build menu, Generate Signed App Bundle / APK, choose Android App Bundle. Module `androidApp`. Key store `Key.jks` in the AAOS folder containing both repos (enter alias and passwords yourself). Build variant `playstoreRelease` (a *release* variant, never debug). Finish. The `.aab` appears in the module's `release` build folder.
4. **Owner or agent: sanity check the file.** `jarsigner -verify <file>.aab` should say "jar verified". Confirm the file name and date are the new ones, not an old bundle.
5. **Owner: upload.** Play Console, the Nuvio app, Test and release, Testing, **Internal testing**, Create new release, upload the `.aab`, review, roll out.
6. **Owner: install on the car** from the Play Store on the Polestar 3 (internal testing invitation). The debug build uses `com.JF_Nuvio.debug`; it is emulator-only and must never be installed on, or distributed to, the car.
7. **Record.** Update "Last uploaded to Play" above and add an `AAOS_LOG.md` entry. Optional: `git tag play-<code>` and push the tag.

## Never

- Never upload or install a debug build on the car.
- Never change the application ID; it must match the existing Play listing.
- Never replace the key, or commit/print/share it or its passwords.
- Never put real-vehicle claims in the log unless the owner actually tested on the car.
